# Faster ASR Detection / RoBERTa Mental Health Classifier

## Overview

This project is an **ML-based system** for detecting emotions / mental health indicators in text or audio.  
It combines:

- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)** for audio input  
- **RoBERTa-based classifier** for text sentiment or mental health detection  

The goal is to build a **fast, accurate, and modular ML pipeline** for research or production use.

## Features

- Audio-to-text conversion (ASR)  
- Text preprocessing and tokenization  
- RoBERTa-based mental health classification  
- Modular structure for adding datasets, models, or custom preprocessing  
- Clean GitHub repo structure with large models excluded (`.safetensors`, datasets, checkpoints)
